This is a repository for practical machine learning course project
In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
Based on these data we are going to build a prediction model, which predicts the manner in which the excersize is done according to quantified variables.
